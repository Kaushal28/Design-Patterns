57. What will be the output of the following python code?
```python
for i in range(10):
  i += 1
  print(i)
```
This will print 1 to 10 because the range of the for loop in python depends on the length of `range()` function unlike Java or C where the iterator variable determines the length of the loop. Here i will be overwritten every time.

58. What will be the output of the following python code?
```python
def to_append(ele, to=[])
  to.append(ele)
  return to

print(to_append(12))
print(to_append(42))
```

This would print `[12]` and `[12, 42]` because default values are evaluated at the time of function definition instead of function execution in python.
